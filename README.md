# Machine-Learning

• Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighboring classification methods were evaluated on  Glass Identification data set from UCI's Machine Learning data repository. Evaluation of these methods were conducted.
<br>
• Linear Regression, Ridge Regression , along with cross validation were applied to Boston Housing dataset from UCI's Machine Learning data repository. Feature selection with correlation and polynomial feature expansion was implemented.
<br>
• Linear and Kernel(polynomial/RBF) SVM classification was used on Phishing websites data set from UCI's Machine Learning repository. Extensive Bias Variance trade off situations were studied.
<br>
• Deep learning(Neural Nets) with different activation functions and regularizations were analysed on MiniBooNE particle identication dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
<br>
• K Means, Kernel K Means and Gaussian Mixture Model were implemented on the given circle and blob dataset to minimize the distortion measure
